Week 2:
1. sortFunctions.quickSort()
My List: [1, 4, 3, 7, 1, 4, 4, 4, 0, 8]
bigNum is 6 and the value is 0
bigNum is 7 and the value is 0
bigNum is 8 and the value is 0
Quick Sorted: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

1. returns a list of 0 instead of sorted list
2. if list is sorted, infinite loop of sorting

Try using python profile to compare performance
